                <p>Hello! I'm Nick Barrie, a driven Computer Science student with a passion for software development and quality assurance. Currently, I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Science Honours degree at Western University in London, Ontario.</p>
<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am gaining invaluable hands-on experience as a QA Automation Intern at J.D. Power. In this role, I contribute to the Stellantis team, ensuring the quality and reliability of data for prominent platforms like jeep.com and ramtrucks.com.</p>
<p>Proficient in Java, Python, and C, I leverage my skills to tackle challenges and deliver robust solutions. Collaboration is a key to my efforts, and I take pride in my ability to communicate effectively and thrive in team environments.</p>
<p>Driven by a pursuit of knowledge and fueled by curiosity, I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. I believe that determination and dedication are key ingredients for success, and I strive to embody these qualities in all aspects of my work.</p>
