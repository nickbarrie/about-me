                </a>

                <p>Crash Recovery is an adventure game written in Java, representing a significant effort in my
                    programming journey. With a robust architecture consisting of over 40 Java classes, this project
                    served as a pivotal learning experience, allowing me to tackle the complexities of a
                    larger-scale program. Throughout its development, I encountered numerous challenges and lessons,
                    enriching my understanding of software design and implementation.

                    <p> In Crash Recovery, players embark on a journey through various levels, tasked with defending

                        scattered across the terrain, crucial for repairing the protagonist's vessel following a
                        crash landing. This adventure not only showcased my technical skills but also fostered
                        creativity and problem-solving abilities, shaping me into a more proficient developer. </p>

                <p> Barrie Clean is a website made for a mock car detailing company. It was developed to practice
                    full stack development. The website was originally built using Vue, Node.js and MYSQL. Then changed
                    to utilize firebase. The website allows
                    users to book appointments, view services, contact the company, and extra controls for the admin
                    such as viewing all appointments and deleting them.

                <p> Changing to firebase allowed for more features such as user authentication, and the ability to store
                    data in the cloud. This project
                    was a great learning experience for me as it allowed me to learn how to use firebase and how to
                    change a project from using a SQL database to
                    using firebase.

                </a>

                <p> Particle simulator is a project witten in C that simulates bouncing spheres in a cube. The project was developed 
                    to gain a better understanding of 3D graphics and physics. The project uses the SDL library to render to the 
                    screen. Using wasd keys the user can move the camera around the cube and using the arrow keys the user can change the 
                    angle of the camera. The user can also change the number of particles in the cube and the size of the particles. The user
                    click on particles to observe some stats about it. Using SDL provided a lower level of control over rending which allowed 
                    me to learn more about the process of rendering a 3D scene 
                    on a 2D screen.
